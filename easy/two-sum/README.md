# Two Sum
## Goal
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two
numbers such that they add up to target.`,

## Instructions
Define a Python function called "twoSum" that accepts two parameters. The first
parameter will be an array of integers, and the second parameter will be an
integer. The function should return a list of two integers that are the indices
of the two numbers in the input array that add up to the target integer. You may
assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the
same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

A Python file with the required function signature has been provided in the
`src` folder. Add the necessary code to implement the function correctly.
